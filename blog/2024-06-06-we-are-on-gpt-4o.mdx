Great news! ðŸš€ Tolgee Translator is now backed by GPT-4o, the latest OpenAI's flagship model. It returns better results, and it is much less error-prone.

<!--truncate-->

## It fails less
The GPT-3-turbo we used before sometimes failed since it could not provide results for some string language
pairs. Due to this problem, sometimes the translation fails. The GPT 4o is more stable.

## It understands the context better
The GPT-4o better understands the context of the strings gathered from the Tolgee SDKs.
So, it provides better results based on the context provided.
Read more about the Tolgee Context [here](/js-sdk#automatic-context-collection).

## It honors the AI Customization more
If you provide a key description, project description or key description, the Translator will use this
information to provide better results.
In GPT-3-turbo, we have seen results where this information wasn't completely honored, probably due to
the overall complexity of the prompt. For GPT-4o, the results are improved a lot. Read more about the AI Customization
[here](/platform/projects_and_organizations/ai-translation-customization).
